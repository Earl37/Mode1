To dynamically create a list of workers, we use num_workers to define the (atleast) 400 workers. We run the print command to verify a list of 10 workers and then for all the 400 workers to include payslips being generated for each. It is observed that each worker is uniquely identified as ‘Worker 1’ to ‘Worker 400’.

Now, we include salary and gender attributes randomly, with all employees earning at least $5,000 and not more than $30,000 and being either male or female.

We set the parameters for the conditional statements using if, elif, and else to qualify who falls under A1, A5-F, and Other. Those categorized as Other do not meet either of our conditional statements. We run this output for a sample of 10 workers and thereafter repeat for the 400 workers and establish that those who fall under A1 and A5-F respectively are 188 and 84 for our random set of 400 workers. 

Exceptional handling is added to handle potential errors; for example, should there be invalid data, it will return an error since we have indicated that salaries are integers and genders are strings.  In addition, we have set conditions to return unknown if an error occurs during worker processing.

Finally, the Python code is converted to R to run the same tasks.
